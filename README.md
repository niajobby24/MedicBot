# Medical Chatbot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Overview

This project is a medical chatbot that answers user questions about medicines by combining **trusted medical data retrieval** with **natural language generation**. It uses official medical APIs for accurate drug information and a language model (like Mistral) to generate clear, user-friendly responses.

---

## Features

* User-friendly chat interface built with **Streamlit**
* Retrieval of accurate drug data from **openFDA** and **RxNorm** APIs
* Natural language answers generated by a local or cloud-hosted **Mistral LLM**
* Uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to ensure answers are based only on trusted data
* Optional local LLM hosting using **Ollama** for privacy and zero API costs

---

## How it Works

1. User enters a medical question in the Streamlit app.
2. The app extracts drug names and intent from the question.
3. It retrieves relevant drug information via openFDA or RxNorm APIs.
4. The retrieved data and question are passed to the Mistral LLM, which generates a concise answer.
5. The answer is displayed back to the user in the app.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Streamlit
* Requests
* Transformers, PyTorch (for local Mistral model)
* Optional: Ollama for local LLM hosting

### Installation

```bash
pip install streamlit requests transformers torch
```

### Run

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## Notes

* The chatbot relies on trusted medical APIs to avoid misinformation.
* Running the LLM locally with Ollama improves privacy and cost-efficiency but requires sufficient hardware.
* This project is for educational purposes and **not a substitute for professional medical advice**.
